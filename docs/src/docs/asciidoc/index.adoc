= Bookshelf App for Grails

== Overview

The Bookshelf app is a sample web app written in http://groovy-lang.org[Groovy] with the http://grails.org[Grails framework].
It shows how to use a variety of Google Cloud Platform products, including:

- Google https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/[App Engine Flexible Environment]
- Google https://cloud.google.com/sql/[Cloud SQL]
//- Google Cloud Datastore
- Google https://cloud.google.com/storage/[Cloud Storage]
//- Google Compute Engine
- Google https://cloud.google.com/vision/[Cloud Vision API]
- Google https://cloud.google.com/translate/[Cloud Translation API]

This tutorial explores the Bookshelf app in detail, and discusses how each feature of the app is implemented using familiar technologies and services provided by Cloud Platform.

image::bookshelf-app-3.png[]

The Bookshelf sample app stores a collection of book titles. Anyone who has access to the app can add books to the list. The sample app offers these features:

- Users can view the list of books
- Users can remove books from the list.
- Users can add books. They create books uploading a cover image, text int that image is detected and used to populate the book title.
- Users can edit book metadata such as title, description, author or publication date.
- A title and description for spanish and italian is generated on the fly.
- Users can log in with their Google accounts and view the books that they have added to the list.

=== Objectives

- Clone or download the sample app.
- Build the app and run it on your local machine.

- Learn how the app creates event logs that are visible in the Google Cloud Platform Console.

=== Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Cloud Platform including Google Compute Engine.

This tutorial has several steps, and each step is documented on its own page. The final page of the tutorial includes
instructions for cleaning up resources, so you won't continue to be billed for Cloud Platform services.
If you decide not to complete all the steps of the tutorial, see the link:index.html#_cleaning_up[cleanup instructions]on the final page.

=== Before you begin

1. Use the Cloud Platform Console to set up your Google Cloud Platform project:
    * Create a new Cloud Platform project, and then create an App Engine application and enable billing in that project:
    https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/appengine/create?lang=flex_java&st=true&_ga=1.20629880.1963584502.1488379440[GO TO APP ENGINE]
    * Enable the Cloud Datastore, Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage JSON, Stackdriver Logging, and Google+ APIs.
    https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=datastore.googleapis.com,datastore,pubsub,storage_api,translate,vision.googleapis.com,logging,plus,sqladmin.googleapis.com&redirect=https://console.cloud.google.com&_ga=1.20629880.1963584502.1488379440[ENABLE THE APIS]
2. To deploy a Java app to App Engine, you must first setup your environment, see https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/tools/gradle[Using Gradle and the App Engine Plugin] for details.
3. Download, install, and initialize the Google Cloud SDK:
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/[DOWNLOAD THE SDK]
4. Acquire local credentials for authenticating with Google Cloud Platform services:   
`gcloud beta auth application-default login`
5. Verify that your default project is correct:  
`gcloud config list`  
If the project ID listed in the output is not the project that you intended to use for this tutorial, set the project by entering this command:  
`gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]`
where [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] is the ID of the project you created or chose to use for this tutorial.

NOTE: You can create Google Cloud SDK configurations to set configuration properties like a Cloud Platform project ID, and then quickly switch between those configurations each time you use the gcloud tool,
see Managing Cloud SDK Configurations for more information.

6. Clone the sample repository:  
`git clone https://github.com/grails-samples/google-bookshelf.git`

Alternatively, you can https://github.com/grails-samples/google-bookshelf/archive/master.zip[download the sample] as a zip file and extract it.

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with Groovy and Grails and that you have http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/[Java 8] and http://gradle.org/[Gradle] installed.

=== Tutorial structure

The Bookshelf tutorial has several parts that demonstrate how the sample app uses various Cloud Platform services.

The forms part of the tutorial demonstrates how the app uses web forms to to receive and store book information.

The structured data part of the tutorial demonstrates how the sample app stores book information in a SQL
//or NoSQL database
. The app's web page displays a form where the user can enter the title, author, description, and publication date of a book.
For each book entered, the app stores this information in a database, so it can be retrieved later for viewing or editing.

//For this step of the tutorial, you have your choice of two databases: Cloud Datastore or Cloud SQL. After you complete this step with one of the databases, you can move on to the next step.

The Cloud Storage part of the tutorial demonstrates how the sample app stores binary data in Cloud Storage. On the app's web page, the user can specify a cover image for each book. The app stores the cover images in a Cloud Storage bucket.

The authorization part of the tutorial demonstrates how the app provides a sign-in flow for the user. When a user is signed in, any books entered are associated with the individual user. Signed-in users see only their own books.

The logging part of the tutorial demonstrates how the app writes logs that become visible in the Google Cloud Platform Console. Logs of this type can provide diagnostic information during app development.

=== Running the app on your local machine

To run the app locally while you are developing:

1. Create a MySQL database and configure its url and username and password in `app/grails-app/conf/application.yml`

2. In the root of the repository, enter this command to start a local web server:

`./gradlew app:bootRun`

2. In your web browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080]

=== Deploying the app to the App Engine flexible environment

1. Create a configuration file for production:

[source, yaml]
.app/grails-app/conf/application-production.yml
----
bookshelf:
    clientID: {CLIENTID}
    clientSecret: {CLIENTSECRET}
    callback: https://{PROJECT_ID}.appspot.com/oauth2callback
---
dataSource:
    driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
    dbCreate: update
    url: jdbc:mysql://google/{DATABASENAME}?cloudSqlInstance={CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCENAME}&socketFactory=com.google.cloud.sql.mysql.SocketFactory&user={USERNAME}&password={PASSWORD}&useSSL=false
    properties:
        jmxEnabled: true
        initialSize: 5
        maxActive: 50
        minIdle: 5
        maxIdle: 25
        maxWait: 10000
        maxAge: 600000
        timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis: 5000
        minEvictableIdleTimeMillis: 60000
        validationQuery: SELECT 1
        validationQueryTimeout: 3
        validationInterval: 15000
        testOnBorrow: true
        testWhileIdle: true
        testOnReturn: false
        jdbcInterceptors: ConnectionState
        defaultTransactionIsolation: 2 # TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED
----

NOTE: replace the above placeholders with the values of your configuration.

2. Enter this command to deploy the app:

`./gradlew app:appengineDeploy`

2. In your web browser, enter this address. Replace `[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]` with your project ID:  
`https://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot-preview.com`

If you update your app, you can deploy the updated version by entering the same command you used to deploy the app the first time. The new deployment creates a new version of your app and promotes it to the default version. The older versions of your app remain, as do their associated VM instances. Be aware that all of these app versions and VM instances are billable resources.

You can reduce costs by deleting the non-default versions of your app.

To delete an app version:

1. In the Cloud Platform Console, go to the App Engine Versions page.  
https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/versions?_ga=1.17491577.1963584502.1488379440[GO TO THE VERSIONS PAGE]
2. Click the checkbox next to the non-default app version you want to delete.
**Note: The only way to delete the default version of your App Engine app is to delete your project. You can, however, stop the default version in the Cloud Platform Console. This will shut down all instances associated with the version. You can restart these instances later if needed.
You can overwrite the default version of your app by redeploying the app.**
3. Click the **Delete** button at the top of the page to delete the app version.

For complete information about cleaning up billable resources, see the Cleaning up section in the final step of this tutorial.

== Service integration Overview

image::overview.png[]

=== Create a book

To create a book, we have created a form which allows us to upload a cover image:

image::create-book.png[]


=== Handling Cover Image upload

Grails uses a MVC pattern. With the aid of a controller's action and a http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/single.html#commandObjects[Command Object] we can handle this form's submissions.

[source, groovy]
.app/grails-app/controllers/com/example/getstarted/basicactions/BookController.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/app/grails-app/controllers/com/example/getstarted/basicactions/BookController.groovy[tag=save]
----

[source, groovy]
.app/grails-app/controllers/com/example/getstarted/basicactions/CreateBookCommand.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/app/grails-app/controllers/com/example/getstarted/basicactions/CreateBookCommand.groovy[]
----

As you can see in the above code snippets the business logic of the application is encapsulated in http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/single.html#services[Grails Services].

When we upload a book cover image several things will happen:

- The cover image is uploaded to Google https://cloud.google.com/storage/[Cloud Storage]. This will provided use with an image url which
we will store in the database `book` table row.
- Text in the cover image is extracted by Google https://cloud.google.com/vision/[Cloud Vision API].
- The extracted text is translated to spanish and italian with Google https://cloud.google.com/translate/[Cloud Translation API].
- Save the book entry in a MySQL database provided by Google https://cloud.google.com/sql/[Cloud SQL].

=== Uploading an image to Cloud Storage

[source, groovy]
.grails-googlecloud-storage/grails-app/services/org/grails/plugins/googlecloud/storage/GoogleCloudStorageService.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/grails-googlecloud-storage/grails-app/services/org/grails/plugins/googlecloud/storage/GoogleCloudStorageService.groovy[]
----

=== Translate Text with Cloud Translation API

[source, groovy]
.grails-googlecloud-translate/grails-app/services/org/grails/plugins/googlecloud/translate/GoogleCloudTranslateService.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/grails-googlecloud-translate/grails-app/services/org/grails/plugins/googlecloud/translate/GoogleCloudTranslateService.groovy[]
----

The previous service method would be invoked with:

[source, groovy]
----
assert 'Hola Mundo' == googleCloudTranslateService.translateTextFromSourceToTarget('Hello World', 'en', 'es')
----

=== Extracting the text of an image with Cloud Vision

We encapsulate the code which extracts the text in a Cover Image in a http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/single.html#services[Grails Service]

[source, groovy]
.grails-googlecloud-translate/grails-app/services/org/grails/plugins/googlecloud/translate/GoogleCloudTranslateService.groovy

----
include::{sourcedir}/grails-googlecloud-vision/grails-app/services/org/grails/plugins/googlecloud/vision/GoogleCloudVisionService.groovy[]
----

=== Interact with Cloud SQL: MySQL database with GORM Hibernate implementation

We use http://gorm.grails.org[GORM]. GORM is the data access toolkit used by Grails and provides a rich set of APIs for
accessing relational and non-relational data including implementations for Hibernate (SQL), MongoDB, Neo4j, Cassandra and
an in-memory ConcurrentHashMap for testing.

We map books and localizations with the use of Grails Domain Classes:

[source, groovy]

----
include::{sourcedir}/app/grails-app/domain/com/example/getstarted/domain/BookGormEntity.groovy[]

----
include::{sourcedir}/app/grails-app/domain/com/example/getstarted/domain/BookLocalizationGormEntity.groovy[]
----

//=== Handling user submissions with forms
//
//
//The add/edit form allows users to add and edit book submissions within the app.
//
//image::add-edit-form.png[]
//
//When the user's browser requests `/create`, the Servlet Container Engine loads the `CreateBookServlet` and calls the `doGet` method. Then the request is forwarded to the `/base.jsp` servlet, which includes the `/form.jsp` servlet. After the user submits the form, the doPost method of `CreateBookServlet` is called.
//
//In `CreateBookServlet.java`, there are two annotations. The `@MultipartConfig` annotation tells the Jetty Servlet container that the app uses `multipart/form-data MIME type`. for form data. The `@WebServlet` annotation identifies the class as a Servlet and specifies addional attributes. In this case, the Servlet has a `name` of `create` and a `urlPattern` of `/create`. Additional parameters include `asyncSupported`, which specifies that the container Servlet can process requests asyncronously, and `loadOnStartup`, which tells the container to load the servlet and execute its `init() method:
//
//[source, java]
//.bookshelf/2-structured-data/src/main/java/com/example/getstarted/basicactions/CreateBookServlet.java`
//----
//@MultipartConfig
//@WebServlet(name = "create", urlPatterns = {"/create"})
//----
//
//
//The doGet method processes the request for a form and sets up attributes to be used by the JSP file:
//
//
//[source, java]
//./bookshelf/2-structured-data/src/main/java/com/example/getstarted/basicactions/CreateBookServlet.java
//----
//@Override
//public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException,
//    IOException {
//  req.setAttribute("action", "Add");          // Part of the Header in form.jsp
//  req.setAttribute("destination", "create");  // The urlPattern to invoke (this Servlet)
//  req.setAttribute("page", "form");           // Tells base.jsp to include form.jsp
//  req.getRequestDispatcher("/base.jsp").forward(req, resp);
//}
//----
//
//The base.jsp file serves as the foundation for the app's HTML pages. It starts by including the https://jstl.java.net/[JSP Standard Tag Library]. http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/jstl/1.1/docs/tlddocs/c/tld-summary.html[JSTL core tags] are identified by tags starting with <c: and provide Variable, Flow control, URL management and miscellaneous support.
//http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/jstl/1.1/docs/tlddocs/fn/tld-summary.html[JSTL functions] are identified by tags starting with `<fn:` and provide Collections and String manipulation libraries. Here is a summary of JSTL tags used by the Bookshelf Application:
//
//|===
//| JSTL tag	  | Description
//| `<c:if …`	| Evaluate expression test and include content if true.
//| `<c:choose>` | Conditional tag that establishes context for `c:when` and `c:otherwise`
//| `<c:when ...` | Include content if test is true.
//| `<c:otherwise>	If c:when is not true, include this content.
//| `<c:import url="" />` | Include the contents of the url within the page.
//| `<c:out value="" />` | Evaluate the expression for value and display an encoded version.
//| `${fn:escapeXml()}` | Escape special characters for webpages.

//== Using Cloud Datastore with Java
//
//This part of the Bookshelf tutorial for Java shows how to create, read, update, and delete structured data in https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/overview[Google Cloud Datastore].
//
//This page is part of a multi-page tutorial. To start from the beginning and see instructions for setting up, go to https://cloud.google.com/java/getting-started/tutorial-app[Java Bookshelf App].
//
//=== Configuring settings
//
//The `pom.xml` holds configuration information for all parts of the Bookshelf tutorial. For this part of the tutorial, you don't have to add any configuration information. The only requirement is that the `bookshelf.storageType` property be set to `datastore`, which is already done for you.
//
//=== Running the app on your local machine
//
//To run the app locally:
//
//1. In the getting-started-java/bookshelf/bookshelf directory, enter this command to start a local web server:
//
//`mvn -Plocal clean jetty:run-exploded -DprojectID=[YOUR-PROJECT-ID]`
//
//2. In your web browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080
//Now you can browse the app's web pages and add, edit, and delete books.
//
//Now you can browse the app’s web pages and add, edit and delete books.
//
//=== Deploying the app to the App Engine flexible environment
//
//1. Enter this command to deploy the app:
//`mvn appengine:deploy -DprojectID=YOUR-PROJECT-ID`
//2. In your web browser, enter this address. Replace [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your project ID:
//`https://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot-preview.com`
//
//If you update your app, you can deploy the updated version by entering the same command you used to deploy the app the first time. The new deployment creates a new version of your app and promotes it to the default version. The older versions of your app remain, as do their associated VM instances. Be aware that all of these app versions and VM instances are billable resources.
//
//You can reduce costs by deleting the non-default versions of your app.
//
//To delete an app version:
//
//1. In the Cloud Platform Console, go to the App Engine Versions page.
//https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/versions?_ga=1.91866586.1963584502.1488379440[GO TO THE VERSIONS PAGE]
//2. Click the checkbox next to the non-default app version you want to delete.
//**Note: The only way to delete the default version of your App Engine app is to delete your project. You can, however, stop the default version in the Cloud Platform Console. This will shut down all instances associated with the version. You can restart these instances later if needed.
//You can overwrite the default version of your app by redeploying the app.**
//3. Click the **Delete** button at the top of the page to delete the app version.
//
//For complete information about cleaning up billable resources, see the Cleaning up section in the final step of this tutorial.
//
//=== Application structure
//
//The following diagram shows the application's components and how they fit together.
//
//image::java-datastore.png[]
//
//=== Understanding the code
//
//This section walks you through the application code and explains how it works.
//
//=== Interacting with Cloud Datastore
//
//The app uses an authorized Datastore service object to interact with Cloud Datastore. This is a heavyweight object, as it has exchanged credentials for a token that it can use to access the Datastore APIs. The app also creates a KeyFactory obect of kind "Book". The book is the only kind of data that this app stores; in general, however, you can store as many kinds of data as you like.
//Cloud Datastore supports a https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/entities#properties_and_value_types[rich assortment of datatypes].
//
//
//[source, java]
//./bookshelf/2-structured-data/src/main/java/com/example/getstarted/daos/DatastoreDao.java
//----
//private Datastore datastore;
//private KeyFactory keyFactory;
//
//public DatastoreDao() {
//  datastore = DatastoreOptions.getDefaultInstance().getService(); // Authorized Datastore service
//  keyFactory = datastore.newKeyFactory().setKind("Book2");      // Is used for creating keys later
//}
//----
//
//=== Creating books
//
//To save a book, the app stores an entity in Cloud Datastore. An entity has a key and a collection of name/value pairs. The `createBook` method starts with an `IncompleteKey`, which gets assigned a value when the entity is added to the data store.
//The code builds the entity according to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern[Builder design pattern] by making repeated calls to the set method.
//
//[source, java]
//./bookshelf/2-structured-data/src/main/java/com/example/getstarted/daos/DatastoreDao.java
//----
//@Override
//public Long createBook(Book book) {

//
//=== Reading from Cloud Datastore
//
//The `readBook` method takes a book's ID and converts it to a key. Then it passes the key to the get method, which returns an `Entity` object.

//      .title(entity.getString(Book.TITLE))
//      .build();
//}
//----
//
//=== Updating books
//
//Update just requires calling the `update` method with an `Entity`.

//      .set(Book.DESCRIPTION, book.getDescription())
//      .set(Book.PUBLISHED_DATE, book.getPublishedDate())
//      .set(Book.TITLE, book.getTitle())
//      .build();
//  datastore.update(entity);                   // Update the Entity
//}

//----
//
//=== Listing books
//The `listBooks` method returns a list of books, ten at a time, along with a URL safe `Cursor:
//
//[source, java]

//    String cursorString = cursor.toUrlSafe();               // Cursors are WebSafe
//    return new Result<>(resultBooks, cursorString);
//  } else {
//    return new Result<>(resultBooks);
//  }
//}
//----
//
//=== Indexing
//
//Datastore automatically creates an index for each of your properties by default,
//although it is possible to https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/indexes#index_configuration[change this behavior].
//Some queries need more than a single property in the index to complete, such as the Query by user, ordered by Title query above.
//The https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/tools/datastore-emulator[Datastore emulator] will suggest indexes that your app will need.
//
//Create these indexes now:
//
//`gcloud datastore create-indexes index.yaml`

//== Using Cloud Storage with Grails
//
//This part of the Bookshelf tutorial for Java shows how to store images in https://cloud.google.com/storage[Google Cloud Storage].
//
//This page is part of a multi-page tutorial. To start from the beginning and see instructions for setting up, go to link:index.html[Grails Bookshelf App].
//
//=== Creating a Cloud Storage bucket
//
//The following instructions show how to create a Cloud Storage bucket.
//
//**Note: You can choose any name for your Cloud Storage bucket. It's a good practice to name your bucket the same as your project ID, which
//helps to keep the name easy to remember. Bucket names must be unique across all of Cloud Platform, so there is some chance that you won't be
//able to use your project ID as the bucket name.**
//
//To create a bucket:
//
//1. Invoke the following command in a terminal window:
//`gsutil mb gs://[YOUR-BUCKET-NAME]`
//
//2. Set the bucket's default ACL to public-read, which enables users to see their uploaded images:
//`gsutil defacl set public-read gs://[YOUR-BUCKET-NAME]`

//=== Configuring settings
//=== Running the app on your local machine
//
//To run the app locally:
//
//1. In the getting-started-java/bookshelf/bookshelf directory, enter this command to start a local web server:
//`mvn -Plocal clean jetty:run-exploded -DprojectID=[YOUR-PROJECT-ID]`
//2. In your web browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080]
//
//Now you can browse the app's web pages, add books with cover images, edit books, and delete books.
//
//=== Deploying the app to the App Engine flexible environment
//
//1. Enter this command to deploy the app:
//`mvn appengine:deploy -DprojectID=YOUR-PROJECT-ID`
//
//2. In your web browser, enter this address. Replace [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your project ID:
//`https://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot-preview.com`
//
//If you update your app, you can deploy the updated version by entering the same command you used to deploy the app the first time. The new deployment creates a new version of your app and promotes it to the default version. The older versions of your app remain, as do their associated VM instances. Be aware that all of these app versions and VM instances are billable resources.
//
//You can reduce costs by deleting the non-default versions of your app.
//
//To delete an app version:
//
//1. In the Cloud Platform Console, go to the App Engine Versions page.
//https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/versions?_ga=1.119646536.1963584502.1488379440[GO TO THE VERSIONS PAGE]
//2. Click the checkbox next to the non-default app version you want to delete.
//**Note: The only way to delete the default version of your App Engine app is to delete your project. You can, however, stop the default version in the Cloud Platform Console. This will shut down all instances associated with the version. You can restart these instances later if needed.
//You can overwrite the default version of your app by redeploying the app.**
//3. Click the Delete button at the top of the page to delete the app version.
//4.
//For complete information about cleaning up billable resources, see the Cleaning up section in the final step of this tutorial.
//
//=== Application structure
//
//image::java-binary-data.png[]
//
//The application uses Cloud Storage to store binary data, pictures in this case. The app continues to use Cloud Datastore for book information.
//
//=== Understanding the code
//
//This section walks you through the application code and explains how it works.
//
//=== Handling user uploads
//
//It is simple to use the https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-java/apidocs/?com/google/cloud/storage/package-summary.html[Google Cloud Storage API for Java]. In most cases, a single line is all you need to authenticate locally.

//----
//static {
//  storage = StorageOptions.getDefaultInstance().getService();
//}
//----
//
//=== Uploading blobs to Cloud Storage
//Read the file from a POST request using https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html#getPart-java.lang.String[getPart]. Verify the file matches your requirements before uploading it.
//
//[source, java]

//----
// /**
// * Extracts the file payload from an HttpServletRequest, checks that the file extension
// * is supported and uploads the file to Google Cloud Storage.
// */
//public String getImageUrl(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp,
//                          final String bucket) throws IOException, ServletException {
//  Part filePart = req.getPart("file");
//  final String fileName = filePart.getSubmittedFileName();
//  String imageUrl = req.getParameter("imageUrl");
//  // Check extension of file
//  if (fileName != null && !fileName.isEmpty() && fileName.contains(".")) {
//    final String extension = fileName.substring(fileName.lastIndexOf('.') + 1);
//    String[] allowedExt = { "jpg", "jpeg", "png", "gif" };
//    for (String s : allowedExt) {
//      if (extension.equals(s)) {
//        return this.uploadFile(filePart, bucket);
//      }
//    }
//    throw new ServletException("file must be an image");
//  }
//  return imageUrl;
//}
//----
//
//Then, make the filename unique by appending a timestamp to it. Using `storage.create`, pass a `BlobInfo` created with `bucketName` and `fileName`, and set the access control list so that all users can read and pass the file's `InputStream. The result is the public URL for the object.

## Authenticating Users with Grails

This part of the Bookshelf tutorial for Java shows how to create a sign-in flow for users and how to use profile information to provide users with personalized functionality.

By using https://developers.google.com/identity/[Google Identity Platform], you can easily access information about your users while ensuring their sign-in
credentials are safely managed by Google. https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect[OAuth 2.0] makes it easy to provide a sign-in flow for all
users of your app and provides your application with access to basic profile information about authenticated users.

=== Creating a web application client ID

A web application client ID allows your application to authorize users and access Google APIs on behalf of your users.

1. Go to the https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?_ga=1.16303478.1963584502.1488379440[credentials section in the Google Cloud Platform Console].
2. Click **OAuth consent screen**. For the the product name, enter `Java Bookshelf App`. Fill in any relevant optional fields. Click **Save**.
3. Click **Create credentials > OAuth client ID**.
4. Under **Application type**, select **Web Application**.
5. Under **Name**, enter `Java Bookshelf Client`.
6. Under **Authorized redirect URIs** enter the following URLs, one at a time. Replace `[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]` with your project ID:
`http://localhost:8080/oauth2callback`    
`http://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot.com/oauth2callback`  
`https://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot.com/oauth2callback`  
`http://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot-preview.com/oauth2callback`  
https://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot-preview.com/oauth2callback`  
7. Click **Create**.
8. Copy the **client ID** and **client secret** and save them for later use.

=== Configuring settings

In the `app/grails-app/conf/` directory, open `application-production.yml` for editing.

1. Set `bookshelf.callback` to `[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot.com//auth2callback`.
2. Set `bookshelf.clientID` to the client ID you created previously.
3. Set `bookshelf.clientSecret` to the client secret you created previously.
4. Save and close `application-production.yml`.

//=== Running the app on your local machine
//
//To run the app locally:
//
//1. In the `getting-started-java/bookshelf/bookshelf` directory, enter this command to start a local web server:
//`mvn -Plocal clean jetty:run-exploded -DprojectID=[YOUR-PROJECT-ID]`
//2. In your web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
//
//Now you can browse the app's web pages, sign in using your Google account, add books, and see the books you've added using the **My Books** link in the top navigation bar.
//
//=== Deploying the app to the App Engine flexible environment
//
//1. Enter this command to deploy the app:
//`mvn appengine:deploy -DprojectID=YOUR-PROJECT-ID`
//2. In your web browser, enter this address. Replace `[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]` with your project ID:
//`https://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].appspot-preview.com`
//
//If you update your app, you can deploy the updated version by entering the same command you used to deploy the app the first time. The new deployment creates a new version of your app and promotes it to the default version. The older versions of your app remain, as do their associated VM instances.

=== Application structure

The following diagram shows the application's components and how they connect to one another.

image::java-auth.png[]

=== Understanding the code

This section walks you through the application code and explains how it works.

The `LoginController` is invoked when the user clicks **Login**.

[source, groovy]
.app/grails-app/controllers/com/example/getstarted/basicactions/LoginController.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/app/grails-app/controllers/com/example/getstarted/basicactions/LoginController.groovy[]
----

It does the following:

<1> Save some random _state_ to help https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect#authenticationuriparameters[prevent request forgeries].
<2> Save the destination of where to go after sign in.

A service encapsulates the interaction with https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-api-java-client/reference/1.19.1/?overview-summary.html[Google API Client Library],
specifically https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-api-java-client/reference/1.19.1/com/google/api/client/googleapis/auth/oauth2/GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow.html[GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow].
to generate a callback request to Google to handle signing in to a Google account. This app specifies the "email" and "profile" scopes, so it can display the user's email and image on each page:

[source, groovy]
.grails-googlecloud-authorization/grails-app/services/org/grails/plugins/googlecloud/authorization/GoogleAuthorizationService.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}grails-googlecloud-authorization/grails-app/services/org/grails/plugins/googlecloud/authorization/GoogleAuthorizationService.groovy[]
----

Google redirects the user to the `/oauth2callback` URL. After the user successfully signs in, the `Oauth2CallbackController` `index` method does the following:

1. Check that its not a forgery by comparing our `state` with the saved session `state`.
2. Delete the saved session `state`.
3. Get the response `tokenResponse`.
4. Use the `tokenResponse` to get a `Credential`.
5. Use the `credential` to create a `requestFactory`.
6. Use the `request` to get the `jsonIdentity`.
7. Extract email, a picture, and an ID.
8. Redirect to the saved `loginDestination` from the prior step.

[source, groovy]
.app/grails-app/controllers/com/example/getstarted/basicactions/Oauth2CallbackController.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/app/grails-app/controllers/com/example/getstarted/basicactions/Oauth2CallbackController.groovy[]
----

The `LogoutController` deletes the `session` and creates a new one:

[source, groovy]
.app/grails-app/controllers/com/example/getstarted/basicactions/LogoutController.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/app/grails-app/controllers/com/example/getstarted/basicactions/LogoutController.groovy[]

== Logging Application Events with Grails

This part of the Bookshelf tutorial for Grails shows how an app can incorporate detailed logging to help with detecting, debugging, and monitoring potential issues.

=== Viewing logs

As the bookshelf app runs, it writes logging data that is collected and made available in the Cloud Platform Console. You can use the https://console.cloud.google.com/logs?_ga=1.80399703.1963584502.1488379440[log monitoring tools] in the Cloud Platform Console to analyze the logs directly. If you want more detailed analysis, you can use the Cloud Platform Console to stream or import the app's logs into https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/install/logs_export[BigQuery] or export them to a https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/install/logs_export[Cloud Storage Bucket].

image::dev-console-log-monitor.png[]

=== Application structure

The following diagram shows how the app handles logging when deployed to the App Engine flexible environment.

image::java-logs-gae.png[]

//The following diagram shows how the app handles logging when deployed to Google Compute Engine, which is covered in the https://cloud.google.com/java/getting-started/run-on-compute-engine[last step] of the tutorial.
//
//image::java-logs-gce.png[]

=== Understanding the code
There are many Java logging packages that are compatible with the App Engine flexible environment.
Grails 3 uses http://logback.qos.ch/[Logback logging framework]

//This sample uses https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html[java.util.logging], as it's the most well understood. Each class needs a `Logger` instantiated as follows:
//
//[source, java]
//./bookshelf/5-logging/src/main/java/com/example/getstarted/basicactions/ReadBookServlet.java
//----
//private final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(ReadBookServlet.class.getName());
//----


Grails artefacts (Controllers, Services ...) get injected a `log` property automatically. For any other class, you can inject a `org.slf4j.Logger log` property
in any Groovy Class with the  http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/gapi/groovy/util/logging/Slf4j.html[@Slf4j Local Transformation].

You can use the methods `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error` to log with different levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `ERROR`.

Example:

[source, groovy]
.app/grails-app/controllers/com/example/getstarted/basicactions/BookController.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/app/grails-app/controllers/com/example/getstarted/basicactions/BookController.groovy[tag=show]
----

Logging configuration can be configured in the `grails-app/conf/logback.groovy` file.

=== Understanding the logging configuration

When the sample app runs in the App Engine flexible environment, anything logged to `stderr` and `stdout` is automatically collected by Cloud Logging and
available for viewing, searching, and exporting in the https://console.cloud.google.com/logs?_ga=1.79946327.1963584502.1488379440[logs viewer in the Cloud Platform Console].

In this sample, all logs are written to `stderr`/`stdout`.

== Cleaning up

To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud Platform account for the resources used in this tutorial:

=== Delete the project

The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project you created for the tutorial.

To delete the project:

**Warning: Deleting a project has the following consequences:
If you used an existing project, you'll also delete any other work you've done in the project.
You can't reuse the project ID of a deleted project. If you created a custom project ID that you plan to use in the future, you should delete the resources inside the project instead. This ensures that URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com URL, remain available.
If you are exploring multiple tutorials and quickstarts, reusing projects instead of deleting them prevents you from exceeding project quota limits.**

1. In the Cloud Platform Console, go to the Projects page.  
https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/projects?_ga=1.77720276.1963584502.1488379440[GO TO THE PROJECTS PAGE]
2. In the project list, select the project you want to delete and click **Delete project**.

image::delete-project-screenshot.png[]

3. In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click Shut down to delete the project.

=== Delete non-default versions of your app

If you don't want to delete your project, you can reduce costs by deleting the non-default versions of your app.

To delete an app version:

1. In the Cloud Platform Console, go to the App Engine Versions page.  
https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/versions?_ga=1.121892171.1963584502.1488379440[GO TO THE VERSIONS PAGE]
2. Click the checkbox next to the non-default app version you want to delete.
**Note: The only way to delete the default version of your App Engine app is to delete your project. You can, however, stop the default version in the Cloud Platform Console. This will shut down all instances associated with the version. You can restart these instances later if needed.
You can overwrite the default version of your app by redeploying the app.**
3. Click the Delete button at the top of the page to delete the app version.

=== Delete your Cloud Storage bucket

To delete a Cloud Storage bucket:

1. In the Cloud Platform Console, go to the Cloud Storage browser.  
https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser?_ga=1.11738740.1963584502.1488379440[GO TO THE CLOUD STORAGE BROWSER]
2. Click the checkbox next to the bucket you want to delete.
3. Click the **Delete** button at the top of the page to delete the bucket.
